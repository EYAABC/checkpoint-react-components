            My interests include coding, art, and music ,Firstly, I decided myself to become a full stack 
            developer when started playing games in my computer. People around me thought that i was jokin
            Because they thought how I can become a programmer by playing games, but the truth is that 
            â€œI started admiring games not by its visuals but by its working and way it evaluates things
            then I made some research on Gomycode In the past i used to work at a bank.Finally I started 
            practicing to code in Gomycode with HTML,CSS Basics and developed my simple portfolio as one
             my beginners project containing my basic personal details .
